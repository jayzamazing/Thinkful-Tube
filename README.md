#Thinkful Tube
This was a simple project where a user could search youtube videos. In this version I made the images clickable and use ekko-lightbox along with dropbox modal to show a modal with lightbox inside to play the videos. This uses HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery, JSON, and the YouTube API. You can see it working at https://jayzamazing.github.io/Thinkful-Tube.
