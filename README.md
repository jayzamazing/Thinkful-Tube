#Thinkful Tube
This was a simple project where a user could search youtube videos. In this version I made the images clickable and use ekko-lightbox along with dropbox modal to show a modal with lightbox inside to play the videos. This uses HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery, JSON, and the YouTube API. To get it to work, you need to add a YouTube Api key in app.js.
